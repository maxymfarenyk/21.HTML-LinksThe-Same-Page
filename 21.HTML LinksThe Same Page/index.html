     <p>Neanderthal, (Homo neanderthalensis, Homo sapiens neanderthalensis), also spelled Neandertal, member of a group of archaic humans who emerged at least 200,000 years ago during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago) and were replaced or assimilated by early modern human populations (Homo sapiens) between 35,000 and perhaps 24,000 years ago. Neanderthals inhabited Eurasia from the Atlantic regions of Europe eastward to Central Asia, from as far north as present-day Belgium and as far south as the Mediterranean and southwest Asia. Similar archaic human populations lived at the same time in eastern Asia and in Africa. Because Neanderthals lived in a land of abundant limestone caves, which preserved bones well, and where there has been a long history of prehistoric research, they are better known than any other archaic human group. Consequently, they have become the archetypal “cavemen.” The name Neanderthal (or Neandertal) derives from the Neander Valley (German Neander Thal or Neander Tal) in Germany, where the fossils were first found.</p>

     <h2 id="d">First Discoveries</h2>     <a href="#t">UP</a>
     <p>The first human fossil assemblage described as Neanderthal was discovered in 1856 in the Feldhofer Cave of the Neander Valley, near Düsseldorf, Germany. The fossils, discovered by lime workers at a quarry, consisted of a robust cranial vault with a massive arched brow ridge, minus the facial skeleton, and several limb bones. The limb bones were robustly built, with large articular surfaces on the ends (that is, surfaces at joints that are typically covered with cartilage) and bone shafts that were bowed front to back. The remains of large extinct mammals and crude stone tools were discovered in the same context as the human fossils. Upon first examination, the fossils were deemed by anatomists as representing the oldest known human beings to inhabit Europe. Others disagreed and labeled the fossils H. neanderthalensis, a species distinct from H. sapiens. Some anatomists suggested that the bones were those of modern humans and that the unusual form was the result of pathology. This flurry of scientific debate coincided with the publication of On the Origin of Species (1859) by Charles Darwin, which provided a theoretical foundation upon which fossils could be viewed as a direct record of life over geologic time. When two fossil skeletons that resembled the original Feldhofer remains were discovered at Spy, Belgium, in 1886, the pathology explanation for the curious morphology of the bones was abandoned.</p>

     <p>Presumed ancestors of the Neanderthals were discovered at <strong>Sima de los Huesos</strong> (“Pit of the Bones”), at the Atapuerca site in Spain, dated to about 430,000 years ago, which yielded an impressive number of remains of all life stages. Sometimes these remains are attributed to H. heidelbergensis or archaic H. sapiens if one accepts Neanderthals as H. sapiens neanderthalensis—in other words, as a subspecies of modern humans. Presumed descendants of Neanderthals include a “love child” with both Neanderthal and modern human physical features from Portugal (Lagar Velho), dated to about 24,500 years ago.</p>
